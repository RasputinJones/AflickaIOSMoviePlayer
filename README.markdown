#### Sample code

Replicates much of the behavior of MPMoviePlayerViewController -- but uses AVFoundation.

There are probably bugs. It hasn't been widely tested. The code is fresh, not at all battle-scarred yet.

(This code was created to work around a bug in iOS 4 where MPMovie* doesn't work after playing a movie that's embedded in HTML via video tag or similar.)

This repository includes a demo app that uses NGMoviePlayerViewController.

The graphics are just placeholders. You can use them if you want to, of course, but you probably want to replace them.
